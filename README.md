# Time-Series Forecasting of Apple Stock Prices with LSTM Model
In this project, I developed a time-series forecasting model to predict future trends in Apple stock prices using the latest available data. The process began by splitting the stock price data into training and test sets, ensuring a robust evaluation of the model's performance. I then trained a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, specifically designed to handle sequential data, to capture the underlying patterns in the stock prices. The LSTM model was chosen for its ability to effectively predict future price movements, leveraging its capability to remember long-term dependencies. The result was a highly accurate prediction model, capable of forecasting future stock prices with precision, providing valuable insights for market trend analysis.
